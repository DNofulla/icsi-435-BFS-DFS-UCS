# Daniel Nofulla ICSI 435 Homework 1

- Graphs_and_Helpers.py holds all the Graphs (Hard Coded because nothing says it is not allowed), 3 helper functions and the map of vertices

- DFS_G1.py holds all the DFS Functions for Graph 1 (4 Functions - Matrix and Vertex by Stack and Recursion)
- DFS_G2.py holds all the DFS Functions for Graph 2 (4 Functions - Matrix and Vertex by Stack and Recursion)

- BFS_G1.py holds all the BFS Functions for Graph 1 (4 Functions - Matrix and Vertex by Stack and Recursion)
- BFS_G2.py holds all the BFS Functions for Graph 2 (4 Functions - Matrix and Vertex by Stack and Recursion)

- UCS_G3.py holds all the DFS Functions for Graph 2 (2 Functions - Matrix and Vertex by Priority Queue)
- UCS_G4.py holds all the DFS Functions for Graph 2 (2 Functions - Matrix and Vertex by Priority Queue)

- run.py runs the program

# Wrong Functions but still implemented (to an extent)

- On BFS_G1.py, Recursive Implementations have a few issues with both the path and the expanded steps
- On BFS_G2.py, Recursive Implmenetaions have a few issues with the expanded steps on the vertex implementation and both the path and expanded steps on the matrix implementation

# Functions with no attempt at implementation

- None

# Libraries and Python Default Data Structure Implementations Used

- numpy==1.21.2
- PriorityQueue from queue
- Stack
- Dictionaries
- Arrays
