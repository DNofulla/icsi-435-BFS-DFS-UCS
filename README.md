- G1 is an undirected, unweighted graph.
- G2 is a directed, unweighted graph.
- G3 is an undirected, weighted graph.
- G4 is a directed, weighted graph.

We need 8 Graphs, G1 G2 G3 and G4 with both the Vertex-List and Adjacency-Matrix implementation.

We gotta have BFS, DFS working with both recursion and stack for the G1 and G2 Graphs with either the Vertex-List or Adjacency Matrix implementations.

We gotta have UCS work with a Priority Queue for the G3 and G4 Graphs with either the Vertex-List or Adjacency Matrix implementations.
